Description:

1xio is a set of primitives to provide rfc-compliant http artifacts for pure-functional java code.

1xio started out as a 7-line http server written in java.  It has since been refactored over time in conjunction with
RelaxFactory REST platform to provide only the starting point for clean-slate reinvention of web scalability for java.

Existing production applications using 1xio have included powering cloud infrastructures and providing data acquisition features to
hadoop and high volume ad server operations as an exoskeleton to enable REST refactorings without interrupting
production services.
