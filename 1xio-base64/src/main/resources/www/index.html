<h1>Base-64 and Hex codecs in the form of Character encodings.</h1>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">
<p>The inspiration for this comes from the RFE <a
 href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4235519">4235519</a>
 which request proper access to Base-64 encoding and decoding as part of the
 java libraries. People have been using a codec in sun.misc.*, but this was never
 supported and, lo and behold, the API has disappeared in <b>Tiger</b>.
 
 <p>These codecs translate between byte sequences and characters so, in many ways,
 the natural place for them is in the character encoding system. In a real sense they're
 just another interpretation of binary data as characters.</p>
 
 <p>By creating an approprate CharsetProvider class which can be referenced from
 the META-INF/services directory this library enables the codecs to be invoked
 just by using their names, especially in String.getBytes and the String constructor
 from bytes.</p>
 
 <p>The most important non-standard behaviour of these codecs is that, in the event
 that the characters supplied to the Encoder not being valid code they throw a
 IllegalArgumentException, rather that substitute a "?" byte, a useless behaviour
 in this context. I'd rather have thrown an appropriate exception from the java.nio.charset
 set, but unfortunately the conversion methods in String intercept these.</p>
 
 <p>The CharsetProvider treat the encoding "name" passed in a rather special way, gleaning
 extra information from  it.<p>
 <dl><dt>base64</dt><dd>Generates standard base64 without whitespace.</dd>
 <dt>base64:nn</dt><dd>Where nn is a number between 4 and 1024, inserts a line
 break every nn characters when encoding.</dd>
 <dt>hex</dt><dd>Generates standard hex using lower case letters a-f.</dd>
 <dt>HEX</dt><dd>Generates hex using upper case letters for A-F.</dd>
 <dt>hex:nn</dt><dd>Generates hex with line breaks every nn characters.</dd>
 </dl>
<p>When compiling these, remember the services directory must be copied
to the META-INF in the build/classes or whatever, where it will be
incorporated in the jar.</p>
